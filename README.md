# core-redux
core-redux is the repository I created for basic core redux without using any front end JavaScript fremwork or libraries. Redux itself is a complete js library and this is going to help the beginners who want to understand the core concept of redux without any complex folder structure or within any other libraris like React.js or Angular.js.
